  <h1>sP1.1 – Identify, Prioritize and Aggregate Supply Chain Requirements</h1>

  <p>
    This process focuses on understanding what the supply chain needs to deliver, both now and in the future.
    It involves gathering demand signals, aligning them with strategic goals, and consolidating requirements across business units and geographies.
    Prioritization ensures that limited resources are allocated to the most critical needs.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Activities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>🔍 Collect demand forecasts and customer requirements</li>
    <li>📌 Prioritize requirements based on strategic importance and constraints</li>
    <li>📊 Aggregate data across products, regions, and time horizons</li>
    <li>🤝 Collaborate with stakeholders to validate assumptions</li>
    <li>⚖️ Balance demand with available supply chain capacity</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Outcomes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>✅ Clear visibility into short- and long-term supply chain needs</li>
    <li>📈 Improved alignment between planning and execution</li>
    <li>🧠 Informed decision-making for resource allocation and risk mitigation</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Process Example: BPMN Diagram</h2>
<p>
  Below is a BPMN-style illustration of how supply chain requirements can be identified, prioritized, and aggregated. 
  This visual helps clarify the flow from demand sensing to strategic alignment.
